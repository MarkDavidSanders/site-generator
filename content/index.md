# I've Never Read Lord Of the Rings

Here's the deal, **I don't know who the dude in this picture is**.

## I've never read these blog posts, either

- [Why Glorfindel is More Impressive than Legolas](/blog/glorfindel)
- [Why Tom Bombadil Was a Mistake](/blog/tom)
- [The Unparalleled Majesty of "The Lord of the Rings"](/blog/majesty)

## The nerds who taught me how to build this site say this is why they like Tolkien

- You can spend years studying the legendarium and still not understand its depths
- It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
- Disney _didn't ruin it_ (okay, but Amazon might have)
- Workers of Amazon unite! Seize the means of production
- It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

## I don't know who half of these people are

1. Gandalf
2. Bilbo
3. Sam
4. Glorfindel
5. Galadriel
6. Elrond
7. Thorin
8. Sauron
9. Aragorn

Here's what `elflang` looks like (the perfect coding language):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Aiya, Ambar!")
}
```

Are we vibe-coding in Elvish now? Jesus.
